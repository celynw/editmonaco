# editmonaco

A really powerful and intuitive beets plugin to edit metadata.
Based on the monaco editor (think VSCode), it allows for extensive features such as multiple cursors, and runs in the web browser.

Launching the plugin should be identical to the [`edit` plugin](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/edit.html), with a simple change of the plugin name.
For example:

```bash
beet editmonaco Coldplay
```

> [!NOTE]
> For now, it only works when this directory is the working directory

This will open the page in your web browser with the current values (it doesn't access the internet).

> [!NOTE]
> If running from WSL, set the `BROWSER` environment variable to the path to your browser for it to open the page automatically!

Edit to your heart's content, and when you're done, press <kbd>Submit</kbd>


## Development

### Setup

#### git

From the [bun documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/install/lockfile):

```bash
git config diff.lockb.textconv bun
git config diff.lockb.binary true
```

### bun

From this directory:

```bash
bun install
```

### python

Use your system python, or whatever beets uses!

```bash
pip install -r beetsplug/requirements.txt
```

### browser-sync

For development, after running the `beet` command (so that the websocket and server is running), run the following command to enable refreshes when changing the code:

```bash
npx browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:8337" -f metadata.js --port 8338 --ui-port 8339
```

I also use the option `-b "$BROWSER"` from WSL.

### Standalone

Run `beetsplug/editmonaco.py` directly, it will start with some dummy data.
By default, it is set to *not* open the browser automatically, so that [browser-sync](#browser-sync) can be used.

### beets

Add the path to the path where you cloned this repository to your beets config (typically `~/.config/beets/config.yaml`).
For instance:

```yaml
pluginpath:
  - ~/PATH/editmonaco/beetsplug
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to temporarily remove other plugins from the `plugins` list if you're having trouble with dedicated python environments.

### Program flow

WIP

- ó°Œ  `EditMonacoPlugin`
  - `._edit_command()` [with `args`]
  - `.edit()` [with `fields: dict`]
  - `.edit_objects()` [with `fields: dict`]
    - Create temporary file containing `fields` as JSON
    - Start HTTP server in thread (`.serve_http()`)
    - Start websocket server with asyncio (`.serve_websocket()`)
    - Remove temporary file
  - `.save_changes()`
- Require monaco editor
  - Open websocket
  - On event:
    - Create editor column for each field
    - Populate editors
    - Keep lines synchronised
